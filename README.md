## 2. My process

### a) Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### b) What I learned

- How to import fonts from file .ttf to the project.
- How to apply hover effect.
- Some codes I am most proud of (which consist of knowledge I have learned):

```css
.card-title {
      margin-top: 12px;
      font-family: 'Figtree800', sans-serif;
      font-size: 20px;
      transition: all 0.2s linear;
      cursor: pointer;
}

 .card-title:hover {
      color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```
